# Problem solving engine

## C++ engine using constraint satisfaction to solve multiple kind of problems
This engine is able to solve Sudoku grids in less than 5 seconds, the four color theorem, etc.
The constraints are written in an XML file that is parsed by the engine to setup the rules of the problem loaded.

### Notes
This engine must be compiled in C++11
It uses the library called "tinyxml" to read the XML file content.
We have not developed the files "tinystr.cpp/.h", "tinyxml.cpp/.h", "tinyxmlerror.cpp" et "tinyxmlparser.cpp".
